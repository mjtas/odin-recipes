      <h1>Baked Fresh Rainbow Trout</h1>
      <img src="../images/trout.png" alt="Trout Image">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This rainbow trout recipe is very easy and tasty. Buy whole, gutted fish with heads and tails still on from the supermarket; make sure to choose very fresh trout. The key is to add water to the dish as instructed in the directions, which keeps the fish from drying out; add hot water as cold water can crack the baking dish. Serve with rice and veggies. It's light and delicious, but be careful of bones!</p>
